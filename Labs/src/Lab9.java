//AUTHOR: Hunter Kasprzyk
//FILENAME: Lab9
//SPECIFICATION: This program show cases my understanding of classes in java by using Student.java the public class to hold methods and variables that can be implemented into Lab9. The methods return information as well as set variables to certain values that are inside the main of the lab. While doing all this the program keeps track of the amount of times we accessed/updated this information and in the end, the program displays the student name, id, grade as well as the times we updated/accessed our information in the student1 class and the amount of times in the main of Lab9.
//FOR: CSE 110 - Lab #9
//TIME SPENT: 3 hours
